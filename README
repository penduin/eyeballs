Ever felt the pressing need to stick a pair of eyeballs onto your web page?

No?

Well here's a way to do it anyway.  Just include the following code anywhere
on your page:
  <script src="eyeballs.js"></script>
...or, if you're too lazy to host a copy:
  <script src="http://penduin.github.io/eyeballs/eyeballs.js"></script>

What?  You want to see it in action?!
